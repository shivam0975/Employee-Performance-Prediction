## ⚙️ ML Model Training Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Inspect and clean the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing/null values.
   - Encode categorical features (`quarter`, `department`, `day`).
   - Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract relevant features.
   - Drop irrelevant columns.

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset using `train_test_split()` from Scikit-learn.

5. **Model Training**
   - Train models like `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`, and `DecisionTree`.
   - Tune hyperparameters for best performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using metrics like:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
     - R² Score

7. **Model Saving**
   - Save the best-performing model using `pickle` or `joblib`.

8. **Integration**
   - Integrate the trained model with the Flask app for predictions.
